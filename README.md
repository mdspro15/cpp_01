We will have to implement ```Zombie```class with a string private attribute **name** as well as member function **void annouce(void)** to announce themselves.<br>
Then implement two functions 
+ **Zombie*newZombie(std::string name)** <br>
  It creates a zombie, name it, and return it so you can use it outside of the function scope.
+ **void randomChump(std::string name)** <br>
  It creates a zombie name it, and zombie announces itself.
We can learn about ```stack vs heap```, ```new``` and ```delete```.
